0,What information should be documented regarding the AI system's knowledge limits and how its output may be utilized and overseen by humans?,[],"The information that should be documented regarding the AI system's knowledge limits and how its output may be utilized and overseen by humans is as follows:
- Information about the AI system's knowledge limits and how system output may be utilized and overseen by humans should be documented.
- Documentation should provide sufficient information to assist relevant AI Actors when making decisions and taking subsequent actions.

(Source: NIST_AI_600-1.pdf, page 27)","Information about the AI system's knowledge limits and how its output may be utilized and overseen by humans should be documented. This documentation should provide sufficient information to assist relevant AI Actors in making decisions and taking subsequent actions. Specifically, it should identify and document how the system relies on upstream data sources, including content provenance, and whether it serves as an upstream dependency for other systems.",0.0,0.9785092602770223,0.0,0.0,0.8190009829645338
1,"What is the importance of implementing safety measures, both prior to deployment and on an ongoing basis, in the context of CBRN information or capabilities and information security?",[],"The importance of implementing safety measures, both prior to deployment and on an ongoing basis, in the context of CBRN information or capabilities and information security is to regularly evaluate the system vulnerabilities to possible circumvention of safety measures.","Implementing safety measures, both prior to deployment and on an ongoing basis, is crucial in the context of CBRN information or capabilities and information security to ensure the protection of critical assets and data. These measures help in mitigating risks, identifying vulnerabilities, and maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive information. Additionally, they contribute to the overall resilience and preparedness of the organization against potential threats and cyber attacks.",0.0,0.9582087889323083,0.0,0.0,0.7026879010012896
2,"How is the AI model validated and documented for responsible use, governance, security, and vulnerabilities?",[],"The AI model is explained, validated, and documented to inform responsible use and governance.","The AI model is validated, explained, and documented to inform responsible use and governance. This includes applying and documenting ML explanation results such as analysis of embeddings, counterfactual prompts, gradient-based attributions, model compression/surrogate models, and occlusion/term reduction. Additionally, GAI model details are documented, including proposed use, organizational value, security measures, and evaluation of vulnerabilities and threats like backdoors, compromised dependencies, data breaches, and other security concerns.",0.0,0.9201337669018613,0.0,0.0,0.47967359161181633
3,How can diverse AI teams establish contextual relevance with domain expertise?,[],"To establish contextual relevance with domain expertise, diverse AI teams can conduct AI red-teaming exercises that leverage both expert and varying contexts where Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) will be used. The AI red teams should demonstrate domain expertise and awareness of socio-cultural aspects within the deployment context for best results.","Establishing contextual relevance with domain expertise can be achieved by empowering interdisciplinary teams that reflect a wide range of capabilities, competencies, demographic groups, and educational backgrounds. By prioritizing opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration, AI actors can ensure that diverse perspectives and expertise are incorporated into the deployment process.",0.0,0.943181025366714,0.0,0.0,0.3184609035750592
4,"How do privacy risks increase with GAI using personal data for training, considering transparency, participation, and purpose?",[],"Privacy risks increase with GAI using personal data for training because the use of personal data raises risks to widely accepted privacy principles, including transparency, individual participation (including consent), and purpose specification. Model developers often do not disclose specific data sources on which models were trained, limiting user awareness of whether personally identifiable information (PII) was trained on and how it was collected.","GAI systems raise privacy risks when using personal data for training due to potential violations of transparency, individual participation (including consent), and purpose specification. Model developers often do not disclose specific data sources used for training, limiting user awareness of potential exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) and how it was collected.",0.0,0.9589003106632753,0.0,0.0,0.993818464230457
