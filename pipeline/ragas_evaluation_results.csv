1,How does the lack of transparency in GAI system training pose risks to privacy?,[],The lack of transparency in GAI system training poses risks to privacy by limiting user awareness of whether personally identifiable information (PII) was trained on and how it was collected.,"The lack of transparency in GAI system training poses risks to privacy by hindering user awareness of whether personally identifiable information (PII) was used for training and how it was collected. This lack of transparency violates widely accepted privacy principles, including transparency, individual participation (including consent), and purpose specification.",0.0,0.9818451965956217,0.0,0.0,0.7442098413520976
2,How can organizations document AI risk within their limits?,[],"To document AI risk within their limits, organizations can establish policies and procedures that address continual improvement processes for GAI risk measurement. They can address general risks associated with a lack of explainability and transparency in GAI systems by using ample documentation and techniques such as the application of gradient-based attributions, occlusion/term reduction, counterfactual prompts and prompt engineering, and analysis of AI systems.","Responses to the AI risks deemed high priority, as identified by the MAP function, are developed, planned, and documented. Risk response options can include mitigating, transferring, avoiding, or accepting. Organizations can document trade-offs, decision processes, and relevant measurement and feedback results for risks that do not surpass organizational risk tolerance. For example, in the context of model release, organizations can consider different approaches such as leveraging a staged release approach.",0.0,1.0000000000000007,0.0,0.0,0.5502662282850637
