0,What are some examples of security measures that should be applied to evaluate and document AI system security and resilience?,[],"Some examples of security measures that should be applied to evaluate and document AI system security and resilience include:

1. Applying established security measures to assess vulnerabilities and threats such as backdoors, compromised dependencies, data breaches, eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle attacks, reverse engineering, autonomous agents, model theft, AI inference, bypass, extraction, and other baseline security concerns.
2. Benchmarking GAI system security and resilience related to content provenance against industry standards and best practices.
3. Conducting user surveys to gather user satisfaction with AI-generated content and user perceptions of content authenticity.
4. Identifying metrics that reflect the effectiveness of security measures, such as data provenance, unauthorized access attempts, inference, bypass, extraction, penetrations, or provenance verification.
5. Measuring the reliability of content authentication methods, such as watermarking, cryptographic signatures, digital fingerprints, access controls, conformity assessment, and model integrity verification.
6. Measuring the rate at which recommendations from security checks and incidents are implemented.

These are some examples of security measures mentioned in the context that should be applied to evaluate and document AI system security and resilience.","Some examples of security measures that should be applied to evaluate and document AI system security and resilience include assessing the likelihood and magnitude of vulnerabilities and threats such as backdoors, compromised dependencies, data breaches, eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle attacks, reverse engineering, autonomous agents, model theft or exposure of model weights, AI inference, bypass, extraction, and other baseline security concerns. Additionally, benchmarking AI system security and resilience related to content provenance against industry standards and best practices, conducting user surveys to gather user satisfaction with AI-generated content and perceptions of content authenticity, identifying metrics reflecting the effectiveness of security measures, measuring the reliability of content authentication methods, and evaluating the rate at which recommendations from security checks and incidents are implemented.",0.0,0.9822961583720383,0.0,0.0,0.9951314988791267
1,How can harmful bias be addressed in the GAI system to enhance transparency and accountability?,[],"To address harmful bias in the GAI system to enhance transparency and accountability, one approach is to implement continuous monitoring of GAI system impacts to identify whether GAI outputs are equitable across various sub-populations. Seeking active and direct feedback from affected communities via structured feedback mechanisms or red-teaming can help monitor and improve outputs. Additionally, evaluating the quality and integrity of data used in training, the provenance of AI-generated content, and defining use cases where structured human feedback exercises would be beneficial can also help address harmful bias in GAI systems.",Harmful bias in the GAI system can be addressed to enhance transparency and accountability by implementing human-AI configuration. This involves sharing transparency reports with internal and external stakeholders detailing the steps taken to update the system for improved transparency and accountability.,0.0,0.9496379444191366,0.0,0.0,0.34952075721560405
2,How can diverse teams improve AI red-teaming in GAI system development?,[],Diverse teams can improve AI red-teaming in GAI system development by using demographically and interdisciplinarily diverse AI red teams to identify flaws in varying contexts where GAI will be used.,"Diverse AI red teams can improve AI red-teaming in GAI system development by bringing a range of backgrounds, expertise, and perspectives to the evaluation process. Demographically and interdisciplinarily diverse teams can identify flaws in various contexts where the GAI system will be used, enhancing the quality of red-teaming outputs. For optimal results, AI red teams should demonstrate domain expertise and an understanding of socio-cultural aspects within the deployment context. The results of AI red-teaming should undergo additional analysis before being integrated into organizational governance, decision-making, policy updates, and AI risk management efforts.",0.0,1.0000000000000007,0.0,0.0,0.5234798693161751
3,How can GAI risks be reduced with adversarial testing and other methods while maintaining operator skills and content transparency?,[],"To reduce GAI risks with adversarial testing and other methods while maintaining operator skills and content transparency, the following actions can be taken:

1. Conduct adversarial testing at a regular cadence to map and measure GAI risks, including tests to address attempts to deceive or manipulate the application of provenance techniques or other misuses.
2. Evaluate GAI system performance in real-world scenarios to observe its behavior in practical environments and reveal issues that might not surface in controlled and optimized testing environments.
3. Implement interpretability and explainability methods to evaluate GAI system decisions and verify alignment with intended purpose.
4. Monitor and document instances where human operators or other systems override the GAI's decisions to understand if the overrides are linked to issues related to content provenance.
5. Verify and document the incorporation of results of structured public feedback exercises into design, implementation, deployment approval, monitoring, and decommission decisions.

These actions help address GAI risks while ensuring operator skills and content transparency.","Conducting adversarial testing at a regular cadence can help map and measure GAI risks, including attempts to deceive or manipulate the application of provenance techniques.
